#  Task : Estimating the risk of death from coronavirus. Write a program that;
#  Takes "Yes" or "No" from the user as an answer to the following questions :
#  Are you a cigarette addict older than 75 years old? Variable → age
#  Do you have a severe chronic disease? Variable → chronic
#  Is your immune system too weak? Variable → immune
#  Set a logical algorithm using boolean logic operators (and/or) and use if-statements 
#  with the given variables in order to print out us a message : "You are in risky group"
#  (if True ) or "You are not in risky group" (if False).



age = input(f"Are you a cigarette addict older than 75 years old?\n Type Yes or No  ").title() == "Yes"
chronic = input(f"Do you have a severe chronic disease?\n Type Yes or No  ").title() == "Yes"
immune = input(f"Is your immune system too weak?\n Type Yes or No  ").title() == "Yes"

if age or chronic or immune == True:
    print("You are in risky group")
else:
    print("You are not in risky group")
