Write a program that takes a number from the user and prints the result to check if it is a prime number.

The examples of the desired output are as follows :

input →  19 ⇉ output : 19 is a prime number
input →  10 ⇉ output : 10 is not a prime number


sayi = int(input("Lütfen bir tam sayı giriniz: "))
if sayi > 1:
  for i in range(2, sayi//2):
    if sayi % i ==0:
      print (sayi, "is not a prime number.")
      break
  else:
    print(sayi, "is a prime number.")
else:
  print (sayi, "please input a number bigger than 1.")
