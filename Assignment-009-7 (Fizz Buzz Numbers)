Fizz Buzz is a famous code challenge used in interviews to test basic programming skills. It's time to write your own implementation.
Print numbers from 1 to 100 inclusively following these instructions:
if a number is multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of this number,
if a number is multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of this number,
for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz",
print the rest of the numbers unchanged.
Output each value on a separate line.



number = int(input())
if number in range(101):
    if number % 3 == 0:
        print("fizz")
    elif number % 5 == 0:
        print("buzz")
    elif number & 3 == 0 and n % 5 == 0:
        print("fizzbuzz")
    else:
        print("none")
else:
    print("input an integer between 1 - 101")
